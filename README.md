## Features & Interactivity
- **Dynamic Dropdown Filters**: The dropdown menu on the right allows users to modify the visualisations dynamically, updating graphs according to selected parameters. This enhances user engagement and enables tailored insights.
- **Title and Type Selection**: By interacting with these elements, users can refine results for specific content titles and types. This adjustment affects multiple fields, including **rating, duration, date added, and description**, allowing for a more granular exploration of Netflix's content.
